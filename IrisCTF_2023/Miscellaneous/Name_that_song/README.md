# 题目描述

Here's an IT song for you. The original title has been redacted. What was the original name of the song? Wrap the title in flag format, all lowercase. Any special characters and spaces should be replaced with an underscore. If the song's name was "Never Gonna Give You Up", type irisctf{never_gonna_give_you_up}.

**Hint!** I did not change the contents of the song, I only removed the title. If you find a song that sounds similar but not exactly the same, it's not the same song!
