# 题目描述

I heard that some common block cipher modes have lots of footguns - using none (ECB) results in the legendary [ECB Penguin](https://words.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/), while others are vulnerable to [bit flipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit-flipping_attack) and [padding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack) attacks, so I made my own that would never fall to such a technique.
