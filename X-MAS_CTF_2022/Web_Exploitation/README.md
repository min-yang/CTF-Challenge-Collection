# 简介

Web exploitation is a category that involves finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. This can include tasks such as finding and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, and other types of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to a web application or its underlying system. Web exploitation challenges in CTF competitions may involve finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a provided web application, or they may involve finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in real-world web applications.
