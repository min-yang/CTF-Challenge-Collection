# 题目描述

Santa's super secret communication network has been attacked recently and we think that the naughty list for this year has been leaked early. The elves have provided the firmware for one of the beacons in the network. Can you figure out how the list got leaked?

# 解决方案

附件中的程序逆向后可以知道几个点，输入`health`会得到输出`Health: pretty pog ngl`，输入`broadc`会读取/flag.txt文件的内容输出到/dev/null，这里需要想办法将/flag.txt文件的内容输出到标准输出，通过输入下列字符可以将flag输出到标准输出：

```
health broadc health broadc
```

对应的输出内容为：

```
Health: pretty pog ngl
Naughty list:
PinkiePie (keeps misplacing stuff everywhere)
Gaybess   (doesn't stop talking about crypto papers)
X-MAS{9L0BAl_vaR1abl35_ar3_fun_wH3N_MULt1pR0C3551ng}
