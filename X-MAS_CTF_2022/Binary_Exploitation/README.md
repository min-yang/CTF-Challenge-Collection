# Description

Binary Exploitation typically refers to challenges that involve attacking and exploiting vulnerabilities in computer programs or systems. This may involve examining the program's machine code, looking for weaknesses or vulnerabilities that can be exploited, and then creating a special input called an "exploit" that takes advantage of the vulnerability. The goal of a Binary Exploitation challenge is to test the participants' ability to identify, analyze, and exploit vulnerabilities in software and systems, as well as to develop and implement effective defenses against such attacks.
