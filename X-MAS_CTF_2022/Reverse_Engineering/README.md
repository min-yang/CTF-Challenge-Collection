# Description

Reverse Engineering typically refers to challenges that involve analyzing and understanding the design and operation of a given system or device. This may involve disassembling or decompiling the system's code, examining its data structures and algorithms, and using this knowledge to solve problems or achieve a specific goal. The goal of a Reverse Engineering challenge is to test the participants' ability to understand and analyze complex systems, as well as their ability to think logically and solve problems in a creative and innovative way.
