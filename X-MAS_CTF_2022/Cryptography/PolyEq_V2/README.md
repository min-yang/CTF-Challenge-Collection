# Description

As you already know, Santa is a math fanatic. This year he spent his summer studying interesting polynomial equations. He found a very difficult problem and he solved it with some clever maths. Now he proposes the same problem for you to solve:

Let f and g be two monic polynomials of degree 32 over Zn.

Let S = {x1, x2, ..., xt} be a set of 2D points in ZnXZn. You know that following equation holds for at least V points:

f(x) / g(x) = y (1)

Find two polynomials f and g such that equation (1) holds for at least V points.

Note: for every point in the set of points that hold for equation (1), g(x) is invertible.

Note: A small change has been made that makes an unintended solution not work anymore.
