# Description

We've suffered a breach in our database and some of our files have been stolen by the Grinch. We managed to get some of them back, but we need your help in recovering the lost data, most especially because we think some of them have been altered in some way.

PS: Start with the image then continue with the zip, Keepass file. Not your typical kind of steganography. :). ”Think like an attacker”
