# LightFTP
* Small x86-32/x64 FTP Server

# System Requirements

# Build 

* LightFTP comes with full source code, written in C;
* In order to build from source in Windows you need Cygwin environment (https://www.cygwin.com/) with GNU make, gnutls and pthreads packages installed. Also make sure Cygwin bin folder is set in system wide PATH variable (e.g. PATH=SomeOfYourOtherValues;C:\Cygwin\bin;C:\Cygwin\usr\bin). To build executable run make command in the Release directory;
* In order to build from source in Linux you need GCC C compiler, run make command in the Release directory. LigthFTP uses GnuTLS, make sure you have headers (libgnutls-dev or gnutls-dev) installed.

### Example for Linux Mint 19.3/Ubuntu 18.04

You need GCC and Make installed. If they are not installed you can install them as part of build-essential package:

      sudo apt install build-essential
      
LightFTP uses GnuTLS library. It need to be installed before compiling LightFTP. To install it, open terminal and use:

      sudo apt install gnutls-dev
	  
or if this doesn't work try:

      sudo apt install libgnutls28-dev  
      
You can download source from https://github.com/hfiref0x/LightFTP/releases or use git. 

In case if you want to use git and git is not installed, install it first:

      sudo apt install git
      
Next use the following:

      git clone https://github.com/hfilef0x/lightftp
      cd lightftp/Source/Release
      make
      
Result binary is fftp. Next setup ftp config, example config file is Bin/fftp.conf. Set port, accounts, path to log file (optionally if you need it), path to certificates if you want to use them, etc.

# Old Windows version
