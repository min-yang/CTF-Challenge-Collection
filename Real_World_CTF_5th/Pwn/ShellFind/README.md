Hello Hacker.

You don't know me, but I know you.

I want to play a game. Here's what happens if you lose.

The device you are watching is hooked into your Saturday and Sunday.

When the timer in the back goes off,

your curiosity will be permanently ripped open.

Think of it like a reverse bear trap.

Here, I'll show you.

~~There is only one service to shell the device.~~

There is only one UDP service to shell the device.

It's in the stomach of your cold firmware.

Look around Hacker. Know that I'm not lying.

Better hurry up.

Shell or out, make your choice.
