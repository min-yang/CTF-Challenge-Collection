Welcome to the Imagicator, the world's most beautiful approach to binary execution. The flag keeps moving around on us, and after public outcry, we've decided to migrate to only allowing family friendly (printable) binaries. But think of how beautiful they'll be!

NOTE: this is the original version of the Imagicator - Family Friendly challenge, while the Imagicator - Almost Family Friendly has been created with an update. To keep the consistency of the game we have left this original challenge for those that may attempt to solve it in its original form, but added the second version so that players may attempt it with that update in place.
