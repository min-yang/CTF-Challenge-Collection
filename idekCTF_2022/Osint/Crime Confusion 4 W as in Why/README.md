You did it! You found the killer!!! But whyy oh why did she do it?

Apparently she was obsessed with stamps, but was it real or not?

Well, I found this image on her computer, maybe it can help you.

Also a nice poem:

```
A man of peace, a collector too
His name, Johan Jørgen, forever true
A network vast, across the land
His passion, stamps, with Olympic brand

A stamp of Seoul, in '88
Issued to commemorate, the games we all love
A rare find, this stamp of Olympic dream
But where, oh where, can it be seen?

A man of peace, his legacy lives on
In stamps and memories, forever strong
But where to find, this elusive prize
A mystery yet, to the collector's eyes.
```
