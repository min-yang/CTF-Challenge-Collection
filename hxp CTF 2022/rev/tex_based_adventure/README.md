Here’s our yearly “wait, you can actually code in this?” challenge.

Update: Do not use docker compose. Just run the container directly (docker build -t tex_based_adventure . && docker run --rm -ti tex_based_adventure). We have removed docker-compose.yml from the downloads, there are no other changes.
